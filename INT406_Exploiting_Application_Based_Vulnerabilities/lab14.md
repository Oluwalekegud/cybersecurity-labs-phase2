# Lab 14: Practice - Insecure Code

### **Objective:**
The objective of this lab is to assess the security of a digital storefront application by identifying vulnerabilities related to error handling and application crashes. You will perform penetration testing activities to understand the risks associated with insecure code.

### **Scenario:**
You are tasked with testing the security of a digital storefront application. During your penetration test, you will attempt to force the application to crash and evaluate how it responds to various inputs and scenarios.

### **Question 1:**
You are testing the security of a digital storefront application by attempting to force the application to crash. Why is this activity included in a penetration test?
- to determine if usernames and passwords are specified in a web application
- to see if developers included informative comments with detailed information in the application source code
- to determine if an attacker can exploit security vulnerabilities when a system or an application attempts to perform two or more operations simultaneously with proper sequence
- to see if the application provides error codes, database dumps, or stack traces that could provide valuable information to help attackers perform additional attacks

### **Question 2:**
When a web application crashes, what kind of sensitive information might be revealed in the error messages or logs?
- User credentials
- Database connection strings
- Application source code
- All of the above

### **Question 3:**
Which of the following actions should a developer take to mitigate the risks associated with unhandled exceptions in a web application?
- Implement a global exception handler
- Display detailed error messages to users
- Use verbose logging in production
- Ignore exceptions that occur during processing

### **Question 4:**
What is the primary goal of input validation in the context of web application security?
- To ensure that all inputs are stored in the database
- To prevent users from entering incorrect data types
- To prevent malicious data from being processed by the application
- To allow for flexible and dynamic input handling

### **Question 5:**
In a penetration test, if you are able to induce a crash in the application, what should your next step be?
- Report the crash and wait for the development team to respond
- Analyze the error message and logs for sensitive information
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability further to gain access
- Document the incident and move on to the next test without further investigation

### **Question 6:**
Which of the following practices can help in securely handling exceptions in web applications?
- Returning generic error messages to users
- Logging detailed error information to a secure location
- Using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully
- All of the above

### **Instructions:**
1. Conduct a series of tests on the digital storefront application to attempt to induce crashes.
2. Document any error messages, stack traces, or sensitive data that is revealed during the crash attempts.
3. Analyze how the application handles these errors and whether it exposes any vulnerabilities.
4. Based on your findings, discuss potential mitigation strategies to improve the application's security posture.

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- A clear understanding of how application errors can be leveraged by attackers.
- Knowledge of common pitfalls in error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Recommendations for secure coding practices and error management strategies.

### **Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that you have permission to perform these tests in a controlled environment.
- Be mindful of ethical considerations when conducting penetration testing.
