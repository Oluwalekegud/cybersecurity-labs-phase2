# Lab 15: Practice - Unprotected APIs

### **Objective:**
Understand the different technologies behind modern APIs, their characteristics, and their security implications.

---

### **Match the Technologies to Their Descriptions:**

#### **Categories:**
- GraphQL
- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
- Representational State Transfer (REST)
- WebSocket
- gRPC

#### **Options:**
1. An API standard that uses JSON and standards such as Swagger and the OpenAPI Specification for ease of documentation and to encourage adoption.
2. A query language for APIs that provides many developer tools and is now used for mobile applications and online dashboards.
3. A standards-based web services access protocol, initially developed by Microsoft, that exclusively uses XML to provide API services.
4. A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, commonly used for real-time applications.
5. A high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization.

---

### **Instructions:**
1. Match each API technology to its correct description.
2. Research and provide at least one real-world example of each API technology in use today.
3. Discuss the security considerations associated with each API type, including common vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

---

### **Additional Matching Questions:**
Match the API features with their characteristics:

#### **Categories:**
- REST
- SOAP
- GraphQL
- WebSocket
- gRPC

#### **Options:**
1. Stateless operations and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. Utilizes XML for message formatting and is heavily standardized.
3. Allows clients to specify the structure of the response data.
4. Suitable for real-time applications like chat and gaming.
5. Built on HTTP/2, enabling features like multiplexing and flow control.

### **Discussion Questions:**
1. What are the trade-offs between using REST and GraphQL in API design?
2. How can businesses ensure that their APIs are both functional and secure?
3. In what scenarios might you choose to use SOAP over REST or GraphQL?
4. What are the benefits and challenges of using gRPC for API development?
5. How does WebSocket improve the performance of real-time applications compared to traditional HTTP requests?
