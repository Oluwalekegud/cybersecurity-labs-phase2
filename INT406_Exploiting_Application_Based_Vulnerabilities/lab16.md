# Lab: Practice - Web Hacking Tools

### **Objective:**
Identify the appropriate tools for penetration testing of web applications and understand their functionalities.

---

### **Scenario:**
You are looking for tools to use in a penetration test of a customer's web application. You want the software to intercept and forward all traffic between your testing VM and the customer's website so you can examine and analyze all of the messages that are exchanged. 

### **Question:**

- [ ] Gobuster
- [ ] Burp Suite
- [ ] OWASP ZAP
- [ ] DirBuster
- [ ] Feroxbuster

   - [ ] True
   - [ ] False

2. **Multiple Choice:** Which tool is specifically designed for finding directories and files on web servers by using brute force?
   - a) Gobuster
   - b) Burp Suite
   - c) OWASP ZAP
   - d) Feroxbuster

3. **Fill in the Blank:** The OWASP ZAP tool is often used for _________ scanning to find security vulnerabilities in web applications.

4. **Short Answer:** Describe a scenario where you would use DirBuster instead of Gobuster. 

5. **Matching:** Match the tools to their primary functions.
   - **Tools:**
     1. Burp Suite
     2. OWASP ZAP

   - c) Scanner
   - d) Decoder

10. **Short Answer:** Explain the difference between active scanning and passive scanning in the context of web application security.

11. **True or False:** OWASP ZAP can only be used for manual testing and does not support automated testing.
   - [ ] True
   - [ ] False

12. **Scenario Analysis:** Imagine you have successfully exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in the application. What actions should you take next in your report?

13. **Matching:** Match the following tools with their primary use cases.
   - **Tools:**
     1. Gobuster
     2. Burp Suite
     3. OWASP ZAP
