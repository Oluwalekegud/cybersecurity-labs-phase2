# Lab Exercise - Pretexting and Impersonation

### Lab Overview
In this lab, you will perform several tasks that mimic real-world social engineering attacks such as pretexting and impersonation. Your objective is to understand the concepts, techniques, and methods used in these types of attacks and how to implement them in a controlled, ethical hacking environment.

### Task 1: Email Spoofing with Business Email Compromise (BEC)
You will create a **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** attack using email spoofing to impersonate an employee from a partner company.

#### Steps:
1. Use an email spoofing tool like `SendEmail` or `hMailServer` to send an email that appears to come from an employee of a partner company.
2. Include the following elements in your email:
   - A spoofed email address from a trusted partner (e.g., john.doe@partnercompany.com).
   - Visual elements (logo, signature) to make the email look legitimate.
3. Send the email to your target (penetration test client), requesting sensitive financial information such as account numbers or invoice payments.
4. Document the responses, if any, and analyze how the target reacted to your social engineering attempt.

### Task 2: DNS Pharming Attack
You will conduct a **DNS Pharming** attack by redirecting a victim’s traffic to a malicious website that mimics a legitimate site.

#### Steps:
1. On the victim's machine, modify the hosts file to map the legitimate domain to the malicious IP address of a cloned website.
   - Example: Map `www.legitbank.com` to the IP address of your malicious server (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
2. Clone the legitimate website using a tool like `HTTrack` or `BlackWidow` and host the cloned site on a local server.
3. When the victim accesses the website (using the domain), they will be redirected to your cloned version.
4. Inject malware on the cloned site for download and observe if it gets executed on the victim’s system.
5. Analyze the results and document the effectiveness of the attack.

### Task 3: Whaling Attack Simulation
In this task, you will simulate a **Whaling Attack**, where a high-ranking individual (e.g., CEO or CFO) is targeted for sensitive information or financial transfers.

#### Steps:
1. Research publicly available information about the CEO or CFO of a target organization (for example, through social media).
2. Create a spoofed email that appears to come from the CEO, requesting an urgent wire transfer to a new account.
3. Send the email to the CFO, using convincing language and urgency to pressure them to act.
4. Document any replies or actions taken by the target, and assess how convincing the pretext was.

### Task 4: Phishing with IT Department Impersonation
You will perform a **phishing attack** by impersonating the IT department and asking employees to update their passwords on a phishing page.

#### Steps:
1. Draft an email that impersonates the company's IT department. Mention that all employees are required to update their passwords by clicking a link.
2. Use a phishing website generator such as `Gophish` to create a phishing page that resembles the company's actual login portal.
3. Send the phishing email to several test users and track their responses.
4. Analyze how many users clicked on the phishing link and whether they entered credentials.

### Task 5: Physical Access with Tailgating
In this task, you will attempt to gain unauthorized **physical access** to a secure area through tailgating.

#### Steps:
1. Identify a target location with restricted access (a server room, office, etc.).
2. Wait for an authorized employee to access the secure area and then follow closely behind them to enter without using your own credentials.
3. Document how the employee reacted and whether you were able to gain access unnoticed.
4. Assess how effective this method would be in a real-world scenario.

### Lab Conclusion
After completing these tasks, reflect on the ethical and legal considerations of pretexting and impersonation attacks. Document your findings and write a brief report on the following:
- The vulnerabilities discovered during the exercises.
- Suggestions for mitigating these types of social engineering attacks.
- Ethical implications of using these methods in penetration testing.

### Submission:
Submit your documentation and screenshots of the completed tasks in the following format:
1. Screenshots of spoofed emails, phishing pages, or hosts file changes.
2. A report detailing each attack scenario, how it was executed, and its results.
3. Suggested defense mechanisms for protecting against these social engineering techniques.
