# Lab Note - Practice: Pivot Attack

### Instructions:
In this lab, you will be tasked with identifying which of the following social engineering attacks is an example of a **pivot attack**. Review the scenarios carefully and select the correct answer. You will then explain why the attack you chose fits the definition of a pivot attack.

---

### Scenario:

During initial interviews and surveys of Pixel Paradise's employees, we discovered that they had already experienced all of the following social engineering attacks. Your task is to identify which one is a **pivot attack**.

---

### Question:

Which of the following scenarios is an example of a **pivot attack**?

- [ ] Pixel Paradise's employees have been receiving emails from a supposedly trusted source with links and attachments.
  
- [ ] Employees reported receiving emails, supposedly from the Chief Technology Officer, William A. Hurst, that look legitimate.

- [ ] One of Pixel Paradise's fan community websites was compromised by an attacker who injected JavaScript code to redirect community members to a site containing malicious exploit code.

- [ ] A receptionist received a call from an attacker attempting to persuade them to reveal information about Elizabeth deGray, the CEO.

---

### Task:

1. Select the option that best fits the definition of a pivot attack.
2. After selecting the correct answer, explain in your own words why the selected attack is an example of **pivoting**.
3. Provide examples of how an attacker could use a pivot attack to gain deeper access into a network or organization.

---

### Submission:

Submit your explanation and analysis in the following format:

1. **Selected Answer**: (Indicate which option you chose)
2. **Explanation**: (Why is this attack a pivot attack?)
3. **Further Analysis**: (How could a pivot attack be used to infiltrate deeper into an organization's network?)

---

### Example Format:
1. **Selected Answer**: (e.g., "One of Pixel Paradise's fan community websites was compromised by an attacker...")
2. **Explanation**: (e.g., "The attack involved exploiting a trusted third-party resource and using it to pivot the attack into a more valuable target...")
3. **Further Analysis**: (e.g., "By compromising a non-critical community site, the attacker could potentially gain access to more sensitive data or infiltrate internal systems by exploiting weaker security measures...")

---

### Conclusion:

In this lab, you have learned how to identify a **pivot attack** and how attackers use such tactics to compromise systems by exploiting weaker points of entry. Understanding this technique will help you recognize vulnerabilities within an organization's network.
