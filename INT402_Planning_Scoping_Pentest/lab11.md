# Lab - Target List and In-Scope Assets for Penetration Testing

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:
1. Identify key technical assets and documents provided by the client to support a penetration test.
2. Understand the role and importance of each asset in the context of the engagement.
3. Explore additional considerations in managing in-scope assets during a penetration testing engagement.

---

## Background / Scenario
As part of the penetration testing agreement, the client will provide a set of technical assets and documentation to guide the testing process. These assets are critical for understanding the target environment and planning the test. In this lab, you will explore what technical assets are commonly included in the scope of a penetration test and why they are important.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Identifying In-Scope Assets
From the options below, select all technical assets that may be provided by the client as part of the test scope. These assets will help the penetration testers understand the system environment and ensure an effective test.

#### Select All Relevant Assets:

- [ ] System architecture and network topology documents
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Wireless SSIDs
- [ ] Credentials and skills of the penetration testing team
- [ ] Non-disclosure agreements
- [ ] The service-level agreement (SLA)

### Part 2: Explanation of In-Scope Assets
For each selected asset, provide a brief description of its relevance to the penetration testing engagement.

### Part 3: Additional Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Asset Importance Prioritization
Rank the assets you selected in Part 1 from most important to least important based on the context of a penetration test. Justify your ranking.

- **Ranking:**
  1. _[Asset name]_
  2. _[Asset name]_
  3. _[Asset name]_
  4. _[Asset name]_

- **Justification:**
  - _[Your explanation here]_

#### Exercise 2: Missing Assets
What other assets do you think should be included in the scope of the penetration test but were not listed in the provided options? Consider tools, access points, or configurations that could enhance the effectiveness of the test.

#### Exercise 3: Case Study - Penetration Test Target Scoping
Research a real-world case where penetration testers were provided with specific in-scope assets. Summarize how the availability of certain assets impacted the success or failure of the penetration test.
