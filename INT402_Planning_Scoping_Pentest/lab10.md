# Lab - Rules of Engagement in Penetration Testing

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:
1. Review the critical components of the rules of engagement (RoE) for penetration testing.
2. Understand the implications of each component in a real-world context.
3. Discuss potential challenges and considerations during engagement.

## Background / Scenario
AIVTIC has just signed a new client for a penetration testing project. Before initiating the project, it is crucial to review and understand the rules of engagement outlined in the agreement. These rules dictate the scope, methodology, and boundaries of the testing process.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Review the Rules of Engagement
Identify the three relevant components of the rules of engagement from the options below. Choose three components that are essential for the penetration testing agreement.

#### Select the Three Relevant Components:

- [ ] Cost of the service and payment schedule
- [ ] The names and credentials of personnel performing the testing
- [ ] The types of tests that will be allowed or disallowed
- [ ] Access to source code
- [ ] The times of day the testing will occur

### Part 2: Justification

### Part 3: Additional Considerations
Consider the following additional exercises related to rules of engagement.

#### Exercise 1: Case Study
Research a recent penetration testing project and identify how the rules of engagement were structured. Summarize your findings, focusing on how the components impacted the project's outcome.

#### Exercise 2: Role-Playing Scenario
In groups, simulate a client meeting to discuss the rules of engagement. One group member will act as the client, and the others will represent the penetration testing team. Discuss the key components of the RoE and negotiate any terms as necessary.
