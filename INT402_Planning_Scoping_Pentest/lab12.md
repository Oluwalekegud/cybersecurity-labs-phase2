# Lab - Strategy: Unknown vs. Known Environment Testing

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:
1. Understand the differences between unknown and known-environment penetration testing strategies.
2. Identify the types of information provided in each environment and the testing methods used.
3. Explore scenarios and challenges unique to unknown-environment penetration testing.

---

## Background / Scenario
Unknown-environment penetration testing (also known as black-box testing) involves testing the security of a system without prior knowledge of the internal workings. This type of testing mimics an attacker’s perspective by providing the testing team with little or no information about the target environment. In this lab, you will explore what information is typically provided in unknown-environment testing and the differences between this approach and known-environment (white-box) testing.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Information Provided for Unknown Environment Testing
In an unknown-environment penetration test, the penetration testing team is provided with minimal details about the target environment. This section will guide you through selecting the information typically provided in such a scenario.

#### Choose the correct type of information expected in an unknown-environment test:

- [ ] Minimal information that may include IP addresses and domain names
- [ ] Network infrastructure and security device configurations
- [ ] Physical and logical network diagrams
- [ ] Application source code and database schemas
