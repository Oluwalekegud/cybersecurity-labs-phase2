# Lab - Create a Pentesting Agreement

## Objectives
In this lab, you will create your own penetration testing (pentesting) agreement.

## Background / Scenario
A penetration testing agreement is a legally-binding contract between the client or customer and the penetration tester. The agreement defines all the terms and conditions required for the penetration testing exercise. The agreement will include elements that are mutually agreed upon by both parties. It may contain things such as the date for the commencement of pentesting, the scope of work, the service-level agreement, the potential pentesting completion date, etc. Other terms and conditions as well as pricing details are also included in the contract.

Imagine that you are hired by a company to perform pentesting. You will need to draft a pentesting agreement between your company and the client. In a real-world situation, you would likely consult with an attorney who specializes in such contracts because understanding them and what information they contain is very important.
