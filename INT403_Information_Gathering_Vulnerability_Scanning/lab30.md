## Question 1
Which tool can be used by an attacker to generate modified packets?

- [ ] Nmap
- [ ] Scapy
- [ ] ExifTool
- [ ] Recon-ng

---

## Question 2
What is the primary purpose of using Scapy in network security?

- [ ] To perform vulnerability assessments
- [ ] To craft and send custom network packets

---

## Question 3
In Scapy, which function is used to send packets over the network?

- [ ] `sendp()`
- [ ] `sniff()`

---

## Question 4
What type of packet can you create using Scapy to perform a SYN scan?

- [ ] ICMP packet
- [ ] TCP packet with SYN flag set
- [ ] UDP packet
- [ ] ARP request packet

---

## Question 5
When crafting a packet with Scapy, how do you specify the destination IP address?

- [ ] `dst="192.168.1.1"`
- [ ] `destination="192.168.1.1"`
- [ ] `ip="192.168.1.1"`
- [ ] `target="192.168.1.1"`
