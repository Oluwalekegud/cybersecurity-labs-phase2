## Question 2
An attacker is using the Nmap tool to perform a port scan with the command:

nmap -sn -T0 172.18.12.0/24

What is the purpose of using option -T0?

nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

What type of scan is being performed?

- [ ] TCP connect scan
- [ ] TCP SYN scan
- [ ] UDP scan
- [ ] ICMP scan

## Question 4
Which Nmap command would you use to perform a scan that targets UDP ports only?

- [ ] `nmap -sT 192.168.1.1`
- [ ] `nmap -sU 192.168.1.1`
- [ ] `nmap -p U:1-65535 192.168.1.1`
- [ ] `nmap -sS 192.168.1.1`
