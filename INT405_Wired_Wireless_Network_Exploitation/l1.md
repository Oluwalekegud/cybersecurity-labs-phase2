# Practice - Windows Name Resolution and SMB Attacks

You have gained access to a host on a Windows domain at Pixel Paradise. A scan reveals that UDP port 5355 is open on a device that is running a version of the Windows server software. You suspect that LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) is in use on the network. This may enable you to exploit the domain server. You decide to run an LLMNR spoofing attack to see what information you can gather. What can you find out using this approach? **Choose all that apply:**

- [ ] Enterprise workgroup names  
- [ ] The names of hidden shares  
- [ ] Usernames  
- [ ] NTLMv2 hashed passwords  
- [ ] The value of registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient`

### Additional Practice Questions:

1. **What is the primary purpose of LLMNR in a Windows network?**
   - [ ] To resolve hostnames when DNS is not available  
   - [ ] To encrypt DNS traffic across the network  
   - [ ] To manage device IP addresses within a subnet  
   - [ ] To facilitate secure remote desktop connections

2. **Which tool can be used to perform LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing attacks in a penetration testing scenario?**
   - [ ] Wireshark  
   - [ ] Responder  
   - [ ] Nmap  
   - [ ] John the Ripper

3. **After successfully capturing a hash using LLMNR spoofing, what can an attacker attempt next to further exploit the system?**
   - [ ] Pass-the-hash attack  
   - [ ] Dictionary attack to crack the hash  
   - [ ] Reverse DNS lookup  
   - [ ] ICMP flood attack

4. **What mitigation steps can an organization take to prevent LLMNR spoofing attacks?**
   - [ ] Enable firewall rules to block UDP port 5355  
   - [ ] Disable LLMNR and NetBIOS in the network settings  
   - [ ] Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  
   - [ ] Upgrade Windows servers to the latest version
