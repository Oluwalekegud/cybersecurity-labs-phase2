# Network Infrastructure Test Lab Questions

### 1. AIVTIC has been contracted to perform a network infrastructure test as part of a broader penetration testing engagement. What components will you be targeting in this test? (Choose all that apply.)
- AAA servers
- Virtual machines (VM) that are running in the cloud
- IPS devices
- Switches
- The digital storefront
- OWASP Broken Web Application VM

### 2. When setting up your penetration testing practice lab, which best practices should you follow? (Choose all that apply.)
- Ensure closed access to the network and internet.
- Create a virtualized computing environment.
- Provide sufficient hardware resources to ensure valid results.
- Utilize the same tool for consistent results.
- Test using one common operating system.
- Use hardened targets for more challenging tests.

### 3. What initial steps should you take to ensure your environment is properly configured for penetration testing? (Choose all that apply.)
- Launch the Kali Linux virtual machine.
- Ensure network access to the targeted infrastructure.
- Use the OWASP Broken Web Application VMâ€™s IP address for testing.
- Disable any unnecessary services on the Kali VM.

### 4. In the reconnaissance phase, which command can you use to discover hosts and services in the targeted network, particularly for the OWASP Broken Web Application? (Select the correct command.)
- `nmap -sP 192.168.56.0/24`
- `ping 192.168.56.101`
- `traceroute 192.168.56.101`
- `netstat -an`

### 5. After identifying the targets, what actions should you take to assess vulnerabilities? (Choose all that apply.)
- Run vulnerability scans on identified targets.
- Attempt exploitation of any vulnerabilities found.
- Document findings for further analysis.
- Only focus on the OWASP Broken Web Application and ignore other targets.

### 6. When documenting your findings from the penetration test, which information should you include? (Choose all that apply.)
- Vulnerabilities discovered.
- Successful exploits.
- Recommendations for remediation.
- Personal opinions about the effectiveness of the tools used.
