# Practice - Requirements and Guidelines for Penetration Testing Labs

You need to set up a penetration testing practice lab because some of the tools that are preferred at AIVTIC are new to you. What best practices will you follow as you set up your lab? (Choose all that apply.)

1. **Ensure closed access to the network and internet.**
2. **Create a virtualized computing environment.**
3. **Provide sufficient hardware resources to ensure valid results.**
4. **Utilize the same tool for consistent results.**
5. **Test using one common operating system.**
6. **Use hardened targets for more challenging tests.**
